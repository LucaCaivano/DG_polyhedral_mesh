# DG_polyhedral_mesh
In this project we designed a numerical method for the solution of the elastoplastic problem using a Discontinuos Galerkin method able to work on a polyhedrical mesh. 

In the code directory all the necessary code is provided with some testcases and examples while all the numerical details and convergence results can be found in the report and in the presentation.
